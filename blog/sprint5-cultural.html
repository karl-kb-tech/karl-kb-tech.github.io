                      <p>Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.
                        <br><br>
                        It has helped to identify somethings that I need to work on, such as better timing.
                        <br>
                        Also that I can learn something new, as long as I focus on that task.
                        <br><br>
                        What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?
                        <br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>the time to reflect on what I have learned.</li>
                            <li>Timing - trying to stick to a plan and also take breaks.</li>
                            <li>Learning to work through to something I donâ€™t understand, and knowing when to ask for help.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <br> 
                        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                        <br>
                        I guess the personality test I took for the values section surprised at accurate it was; which helped me to identify strength and weaknesses.
                        Also how much reflecting on what I have learnt, helping me to understand more.
                        <br>
                        What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                        <br>
                        The meditating I guess - trying to find time to do it, and then trying to stay alert and awake during the meditation.
                        <br>
                        Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?
                        <br>
                        Nothing that I can think of...
                        </p>
