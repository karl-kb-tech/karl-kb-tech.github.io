            <p>What is Emotional Intelligence?
                    <br>Emotional intelligence or quotient is a person's ability to identify, control, express and evaluate their own emotions or emotional state; it is also their ability to identify the same in others, and then how you can them feel.<br>
                    
                    <br> How is it different to IQ?<br>
                    <br>IQ or intelligence quotient is the total measure of someone's intelligence, measured across a wide range of topic from science, maths, biology etc…
                    Having a high IQ does not necessarily correlate with having a high EQ, although both can be taught and increased<br>
                    <br>Why is it important?<br>
                    <br>I am guessing “it” in the instance would be EQ, but could be IQ?
                    Having a high EQ will help you relate a lot better with others in both your professional career and personal life.
                    EQ maybe what gets you hired over the person with a higher IQ who is competing for the same job.
                    But IQ is also important, no one is going to hire someone that has no idea what they doing for the role - no matter how relatable the person is.<br>
                    <br>Mindfulness: <br>

                    <br>What it was like for you to practice mindfulness?<br>
                    <br>Not sure...I should try it in the morning rather than the evening, as I almost fell asleep.
                    It was relaxing I guess.<br>
                    
                    <br>Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?<br>

                    <br>A few times in school and University when teachers or lecturers would make the class do something similar.
                    Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?
                    I don’t really have any bias for or against really, just have to try find the time and give it a proper go.<br>

                    <br>What did you notice as you were meditating?<br>

                    <br>My mind would wonder every now and then, thinking about study or what the noise was outside.<br>
                    <br> How did you find the overall experience?<br>
                    <br> It was alright, wasn’t terrible.<br>
                    <br> What's your daily habit commitment?<br>
                    <br> I have commited to try at least once a day, hopefully it should be easy to find 5 minutes to keep to this commitment.<br>
                    
                    <br>Listening and Looping: <br>
                    
                    <br> What was it like to be fully listened to?<br>
                    <br> It was nice I guess to be heard, then the other person's opinions and what they thought about your situation felt more valid.<br>
                    <br>What was it like to fully listen?<br>
                    <br>It was good, but also a little hard too, two minutes is quite a long time so remembering and reflecting back was a little difficult but I managed to do it. I guess this where the mindfulness and attention training come int to help.<br>
