                                        I am a quiet/introverted person, and would describe my strenghts as loyal and determined.
                                        I can be quite stubborn, but I am also self-aware - so know well when I am getting in my own way.
                                        I agree to take part in all required meetings, classes, and the community as a whole.
                                        I am not working currently so can work productively by myself or within in a group when required.
                                        I agree to seek help when I am finding anything too difficult, I will do this by asking in slack if I think it is simple or I will approach staff or faciltators if slack is not enough.
                                        I will ask for help once I have worked through the list in this article, <a href="https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603">How to be great at asking questions</a>.
                                        The only block out time I will need is in Februay 16th next year, for my cousins wedding - but I will make sure anybody affected by my absence knows well in advance and that
                                        any work (group or otherwise) is completed before I leave for the wedding. I will probably look at leaving Friday afternoon, and coming back Sunday evening.
                                        I acknowledge this will change throughout my time with EDA and will be flexible with this agreement.
