                            <h3> Got blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
                            <br>  <br>
                            During this sprint I got stuck on some of the katas, for example the fizzbuzz challenge.
                            Now this basically involves taking a list of numbers someone gives you and then going through and re-writing it.
                            So it has to be re-written in a way that any number that is a multiple of 3 is “fizz instead, any number that is a multiple of 5 is “buzz”, and any number that is a multiple of 15 is “fizzbuzz”; then you hand this new “FizzBuzzed” list back to the person that asked for it.
                            <br> <br>
                          <h3>What was the problem:</h3>
                          <br>  <br>
                            Well my first problem was trying iterate, or go through the list one by one and testing it by the multiples; then once I had figured out to do that, I needed a way to test if it was a multiple.
                            <strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong>
                            I went back to the list of basic Javascript courses we had done in Free Code Camp courses remembering we had gone through something similar already, between this and Google I was able to work out what was needed.
                            <strong>How did you feel about the process?</strong>
                            Good - it was good to know I had something that I could go back to and reference, then search Google from there to help reinforce the method I was looking at.

                            <br>  <br>
                            <h3> Solved a problem in an elegant way:</h3>

                            I am not sure I did really, there was a lot of write something, delete re-write.
                            I guess the most elegant way did solve something was the rubber ducky way, I read through my code out loud to figure out why it wasn’t working and found a bracket missing.
                           <br>  <br>
                          </h3> How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                            Mixed emotions mostly determined, but there was also a little frustration, and a lot of elation once something passed the final test
                            <br>  <br>
                          <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
                          <br>  <br>
                            That you can do a lot with just the basics we had learnt so far.
                            <br>  <br>
                            <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
                            <br>  <br>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong>
                              Pretty confident, it helps to build up the function and give a clue on what to search for when figuring something out.</li>

                            <li> <strong>Trying something:</strong>
                              Confident, I did this a lot - change something and press run, check result/error, change something else and repeat.</li>

                            <li> <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong>
                              Confident - although it does feel a bit weird talking to yourself I found it helped me find spelling errors and missing brackets</li>

                            <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong>
                              Reasonably confident, using these and looking at what the tests were looking for helped a lot.</li>

                            <li> <strong>Console.logging:</strong>
                              Didn’t use this too much, but it was helpful to see what was happening at some points.</li>

                            <li> <strong>Googling:</strong>
                              Confident - was good for getting explanations and examples of some methods.</li>

                              <li><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong>
                              Confident, although I didn’t need to this sprint.</li>

                              <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>
                              Same as above - I would have had I exhausted everything else.</li>

                              <li><strong> your process with reflection:</strong>
                              Good - I did walk away for a break at some points and think about what was needed to get the function working.</li>
                          </ul>
