Gather evidence:
I would say my personal values are: I can be quiet/introverted, but I am also strong, loyal, and persistent.
I get along with people quite easy, and will go out of my way to find something in common sometimes.

Once I get an idea, one that really appeals it's all or nothing – like when I decided I would move to Canada by myself and live there for a while, even though I knew no one there, and no friends or family there – once I was focused, that was it.

I approached a friend to help with this and got the following feedback:

“You're kind, you help people when you can and you go the extra mile if needed. Like helping Shaoping and I learn how to drive
You're selfless: you always put other people needs over yours, like the many times you mind our houses or cats
You value family: you're a good son and a good brother. You keep in touch and care for everyone.”

I took a Myers Briggs test and was told I am INFJ -A/-T and the weaknesses described I find apply somewhat to me too:
- Extremely private
- Perfectionist
- Can burn out easily
But I also identify with the strengths:
- Decisive
- Determined and passionate
- Altruistic

Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
	
	Explain 	a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss 	how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the 	decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
	
	
In Vancouver I had a door to door sales job for one of their major telecos – day to day I would run into situations where the person I was trying to sell too would ask what I thought about the plans and deals (keeping in mind this was commision based) and I would end up telling them I had only been in Canada for 2-3 weeks so have no real opinions about the company and what is being offered – and my honesty would either end the conversation right there, or end up in a sale.


	
	Describe 	how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
I have a multicultural background and grew up, not poor, but my parents worked hard.
This has influenced me to be a very open person, I can get along with almost everyone.

Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.

	
	Explain 	a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss 	how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the 	decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
I guess my weakness of being quiet/introverted almost got in the way when I first moved to Canada, but knowing this I booked a hostel to live in when I first moved.
This forced me to interact with heaps of people, and helped me make friends.

	
	Describe 	how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
Not sure...being from a diverse background has taught me to relate to anyone.
My Maori background taught me to embrace family and care for them.

	
	Evaluate 	your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career 	development
I guess I have always been aware of strength and weaknesses and have never let them influence my career. When I was close to burning out, I recognised that and took one months leave and traveled to Thailand and across Europe.

	
	Identify 	which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and 	how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
Being introverted might get in the way of presentations, but I tend not to let it.
I am quite good with group projects, so am looking forward to that.

	
	Share 	an example from your experience of where you were trying to work 	productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 	Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they 	were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try 	now, and why.
Any of group assignments for University...I remember one research assignment we had, everything was a last minute rush.
I ended being the person to take on organisation of everything, including making sure everyone could meetup.
It meant extra work for me because I was constantly chasing other people, but in the end we got everything done on time.
Some of the tension came from people not giving the Korean student enough time to talk, which annoyed me.
